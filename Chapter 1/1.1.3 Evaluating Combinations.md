# 1.1.3 對組合式求值 (Evaluating Combinations)

One of our goals in this chapter is to isolate issues about thinking procedurally. As a case in point, let us consider that, in evaluating combinations, the interpreter is itself following a procedure.

本章的目標之一，是獨立出程序式思考的相關議題。舉個恰當的例子，我們來想一下，直譯器對組合式求值的時會遵循這個流程：

To evaluate a combination, do the following: 

1.  Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.
2.  Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost subexpression (the operator) to the arguments that are the values of the other subexpressions (the operands). 
    
對一個組合式求值，執行以下步驟：
 
 1. 先計算出該組合式中的子表達式們(subexpressions)之值。
 2. 將最左方的子表達式（運算子）所代表的程序，套用到那些身為參數的其餘子表達式（運算元）上。

Even this simple rule illustrates some important points about processes in general. First, observe that the first step dictates that in order to accomplish the evaluation process for a combination we must first perform the evaluation process on each element of the combination. Thus, the evaluation rule is recursive in nature; that is, it includes, as one of its steps, the need to invoke the rule itself.

即便是如此簡單的規則，也闡明了一些關於普通程序的重要意義。首先，請注意第一個步驟的要求──為了完成一個組合式的求值程序，我們必須先完成其中每一個元素的求值程序。因此這個求值規則自然而然地成為一個 *遞迴(recursive)*的規則；也就是說，這個規則的包涵了一個步驟，而這個步驟又必須呼叫這個規則本身。

Notice how succinctly the idea of recursion can be used to express what, in the case of a deeply nested combination, would otherwise be viewed as a rather complicated process. For example, evaluating

注意遞迴的概念是如何簡潔地表示深層巢狀的組合，否則會是更複雜的過程。舉例來說，對下列式子求值：

```lisp
(* (+ 2 (* 4 6))
   (+ 3 5 7))
```

requires that the evaluation rule be applied to four different combinations. We can obtain a picture of this process by representing the combination in the form of a tree, as shown in figure 1.1. Each combination is represented by a node with branches corresponding to the operator and the operands of the combination stemming from it. The terminal nodes (that is, nodes with no branches stemming from them) represent either operators or numbers. Viewing evaluation in terms of the tree, we can imagine that the values of the operands percolate upward, starting from the terminal nodes and then combining at higher and higher levels. In general, we shall see that recursion is a very powerful technique for dealing with hierarchical, treelike objects. In fact, the ``percolate values upward'' form of the evaluation rule is an example of a general kind of process known as tree accumulation.

必須將求值規則套用在四個不同的組合中。我們可以將這些組合藉由樹狀的形式展現，以獲得此過程的概觀。如圖1.1所示。每個組合以單一節點表示，每個節點有延伸到該組合運算子與運算元的邊(譯註：stemming暫時翻譯為"延伸"，應有更好的翻法)。終端節點（也就是沒有任何邊從該節點延伸出去）表示運算元或數字。將求值過程視為一棵樹，我們可以想像這些運算元的值會向上傳遞，從終端節點開始，一層一層向更高的層級結合並傳遞。一般而言，我們可以視遞迴為對應階層狀、樹狀的物件，強而有力的技術。事實上，求值規則的``向上遞推數值''形式，是種普遍被認知為樹狀累積的過程。

 Next, observe that the repeated application of the first step brings us to the point where we need to evaluate, not combinations, but primitive expressions such as numerals, built-in operators, or other names. We take care of the primitive cases by stipulating that

其次，觀察到我們必須求值計算的，不是這些組合，而是原生表達式，諸如數值，內建運算子，或其他變數名稱。我們藉由以下約定規範原生的案例
- the values of numerals are the numbers that they name,
- the values of built-in operators are the machine instruction sequences that carry out the corresponding operations, and
- the values of other names are the objects associated with those names in the environment. 

- 數字符號的值就是它字面上的數字
- 內建運算元的值是一串機器碼執行對應的運算，並且
- 其他變數名稱的值，是在上下文環境中綁定這些名稱的物件

We may regard the second rule as a special case of the third one by stipulating that symbols such as + and * are also included in the global environment, and are associated with the sequences of machine instructions that are their ``values.'' The key point to notice is the role of the environment in determining the meaning of the symbols in expressions. In an interactive language such as Lisp, it is meaningless to speak of the value of an expression such as (+ x 1) without specifying any information about the environment that would provide a meaning for the symbol x (or even for the symbol +). As we shall see in chapter 3, the general notion of the environment as providing a context in which evaluation takes place will play an important role in our understanding of program execution.

我們或許可以藉由以下方式將第二條規則視為第三條規則的特例：符號「+」和「*」視為也被包含在全域環境中，以及它們所綁定的一串機器碼就是其值。要注意的關鍵是上下文環境所扮演的角色，它會決定表達式中的符號代表什麼意義。像Lisp這樣的互動式語言，光說（+ x 1）這樣的表達式，而不提供上下文環境說明符號x（甚至是+）代表的意思，是沒有意義的。如我們將在第三章看到的，環境的一般概念，是提供求值計算時的上下文環境，這個概念將會對我們理解程式執行扮演重要的角色。

Notice that the evaluation rule given above does not handle definitions. For instance, evaluating (define x 3) does not apply define to two arguments, one of which is the value of the symbol x and the other of which is 3, since the purpose of the define is precisely to associate x with a value. (That is, (define x 3) is not a combination.)

Such exceptions to the general evaluation rule are called special forms. Define is the only example of a special form that we have seen so far, but we will meet others shortly. Each special form has its own evaluation rule. The various kinds of expressions (each with its associated evaluation rule) constitute the syntax of the programming language. In comparison with most other programming languages, Lisp has a very simple syntax; that is, the evaluation rule for expressions can be described by a simple general rule together with specialized rules for a small number of special forms.11
